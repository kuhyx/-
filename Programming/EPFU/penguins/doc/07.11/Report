Data Structures: We will use int, char, int 2D array for board, char array for names of the players for data structures

Interaction with the user: Our plan is to show a lot of messages to user about what it happening, so for example at the start we will welcome user to play, we will
let users input their names and later refer to them by their names ( using char array ), we will also print out scoreboard with names of the players and scores
we will use printf for showing messages to the user and scanf for getting information from the user

Main loop: Inside the main.c file
