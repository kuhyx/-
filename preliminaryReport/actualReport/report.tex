\section{General overview and assumptions}
initial task proposals (at least: assumptions, variant selection, implementation technology, scope, etc.). \\
My task is to create a translator of \LaTeX \, subset to selected text format with focus on \LaTeX \, tables \\ 
I decided to change to translator of \LaTeX \, subset to HTML since I know \LaTeX \, very well and HTML relatively well, I decide to translate \LaTeX into HTML since HTML is easy, a little bit different than \LaTeX and popular which makes this translator a practical tool.
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No \LaTeX \, (\%) comments in the script 
    \item There are no extra packages in \LaTeX \, script (provided with \\ \textbackslash usepackage keyword) besides ones distributed with \LaTeX
    \item There are no extra classes in \LaTeX \, script besides ones distributed with \LaTeX
    \item There is nothing between \textbackslash documentclass keyword and \\ \textbackslash begin\{document\} keyword 
    \item No standard \LaTeX \, instructions are modified in the script
    \item "Tables" will be represented using \LaTeX \, \emph{table} environment 
\end{itemize}
\section{Functional requirements}
\subsection{\LaTeX \, subset}
This project will focus almost exclusively on \emph{table} environment \\
more speciffically table environment containing tabular inside of it 
\section{Implementation}
I decided to use Python as a language in which I will implement my solution \\ 
The reasons for using python are as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is the easiest language among those that I know
    \item I know it enough to be confident in my ability to implement this solution in python
    \item I want to learn python more through this project
\end{enumerate}
Negative aspects of python which is that it is very slow language do not bother me as I believe the project scope will not be big enough for this to become an issue
